frequently monitored for signs of neurological decline and treated appropriately. One of the known
risk factors following a stroke like Mr. Ward had is swelling of the brain which will result in further
brain damage if not recognized and promptly treated. While on the Hospital floor, Mr. Ward
declined in verbal, cognitive and motor function which multiple providers noted, but failed to take
appropriate action. After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed
a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate
attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had
a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of
brain swelling. As a result of Defendants' delays, Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage. Mr.
Ward now requires around-the-clock care as a result of

Summary of Allegations:
The plaintiff alleges that Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage, including uncal herniation, brainstem
compression, and subfalcine herniation, due to delays and failures in medical care following his stroke. Specific
negligent acts include failure to perform timely neurological assessments, failure to notify physicians of his
declining condition, delays in imaging (MRI and CT scans), and failure to act on test results showing evolving
brain injury. These delays led to worsening brain swelling, requiring an emergent decompressive
hemicraniectomy on February 27, 2023. The resulting harm includes permanent brain damage, loss of motor,
cognitive, and verbal functions, respiratory complications, and the need for prolonged hospitalization,
tracheostomy, and rehabilitation. Mr. Ward now requires around-the-clock care, has lost the ability to work, and
suffers from permanent disability, loss of enjoyment of life, and mental anguish. Damages claimed include
medical expenses, lost wages, pain a

Synopsis:
The claimant is a 53-year-old male and former truck driver with a pre-existing medical history of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (E11.9), hypertension (110), hyperlipidemia (E78.5), class 2 obesity (E66.9), and a history of deep vein
thrombosis (182.90). His past surgical history includes external ear surgery. Prior to this incident, he was on
chronic medications including antihypertensives (Carvedilol 6.25 mg BID), statins (Atorvastatin 80 mg daily),
and insulin for diabetes management, though he had transitioned to diet-controlled diabetes. Relevant risk
factors include obesity (BMI 37.5), hypertension, and a family history of lung cancer. On February 17, 2023, the
claimant experienced an acute onset of left-sided we

controlled diabetes. Relevant risk
factors include obesity (BMI 37.5), hypertension, and a family history of lung cancer. On February 17, 2023, the
claimant experienced an acute onset of left-sided weakness, slurred speech, and facial droop while at a gas
station. His initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 206/110 mmHg and a blood glucose level of 253
mg/dL. Examination revealed left-sided hemiplegia, neglect, and right gaze deviation, with an NIHSS score of
16. Imaging at the outside hospital showed a right M1 occlusion on CT angiogram, with no hemorrhage on CT
head. The initial diagnosis was acute ischemic stroke due to right MCA occlusion. Emergency treatment
included administration of TNK at 07:52 and initiation of a Cardene drip for blood pressure control before
transfer to Memorial Health for urgent thrombectomy.

The patient, admitted on 2/17/2023 with a right MCA M1 occlusion, developed significant cerebral edema and
herniation evidenced by a 1.5 cm right-to-left subfalcine herniation and 1 cm right uncal herniation with
brainstem compression on 2/27/2023, necessitating an emergent right decompressive hemicraniectomy with
subdural ICP monitor placement performed by Dr. Suh. Postoperatively, he experienced respiratory
complications, including intubation on 2/27/2023, extubation on 3/6/2023, reintubation on 3/7/2023 due to
mucus plugging, and a tracheostomy on 3/10/2023, followed by ventilator weaning and eventual tracheostomy
decannulation on 5/2/2023. Cardiac complications included a witnessed cardiac arrest on 4/12/2023 due to
acute blood loss anemia (ABLA) from bleeding at the IVC puncture site, with return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) after one round of ACLS. Renal complications involved acute kidney injury requiring dialysis initiated

tube was placed on 3/21/2023 due to dysphagia. Additional complications included anemia of chronic disease,
acute blood loss anemia from procedural bleeding, and pressure injuries.
Frank Ward underwent a cranioplasty with bone flap replacement on 6/22/2023 performed by Dr. Daniel Suh

Rehabilitation on 6/28/2023 for intensive inpatient therapies, including physical therapy (PT), occupational
therapy (OT), and speech therapy (ST). Functional progress included improved tolerance to sitting and
participation in dynamic reaching tasks, but he remains significantly limited by left hemiplegia, requiring
maximum assistance for transfers and ADLs. Diagnoses confirmed by medical professionals include acute
ischemic right MCA stroke (163.9), left hemiparesis (G81.94), spasticity, dysphagia (R13.10), pain in the left
upper extremity, deep vein thrombosis (182.90), type 2 diabetes mellitus (E11.9), hypertension (110),
hyperlipidemia (E78.5), pressure injuries, incontinence, and skull defect post-craniectomy (S02.91XS). The
claimant's ongoing symptoms include left hemiplegia with strength grade 0/5 in the left lower extremity and
limited ROM in the left upper extremity, severe pain in the left shoulder, spasticity, wheelchair dependence with

Cognitive impairments include decreased safety judgment, awareness of errors, and attention span. Dysphagia
persists, though he tolerates oral intake, with a PEG tube in place as needed.
The causation of the injuries is attributed to an embolic stroke caused by a right M1 occlusion, leading to
ischemia, infarct, and significant cerebral edema with subsequent right uncal herniation and subfalcine
herniation. Contributing factors included uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, as well as
complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute kidney injury. Delays in treatment, including the

progression of herniation before decompressive craniectomy on 2/27/2023, and subsequent complications like
respiratory failure, anemia from procedural bleeding, and recurrent infections, exacerbated the patient's
condition, resulting in permanent disability. Prognosis remains poor, with the patient experiencing persistent
left-sided weakness, spasticity, and cognitive deficits. Maximum medical improvement (MMI) has not been
reached, as ongoing rehabilitation and therapy are required. The patient remains dependent on assistive
devices, including a helmet for protection, and requires 24/7 care and continued physical, occupational, and
speech therapy to manage deficits and prevent further decline.
Office visits and encounters have included neurological, physical, and psychiatric follow-ups, with diagnostic
imaging such as CT scans (e.g., 2/21/23, 2/27/23, 4/1/23, 4/8/23), MRIs (e.g., 2/26/23), and ultrasounds (e.g.,

antihypertensives (Norvasc, clonidine, hydralazine, losartan), statins (atorvastatin), diabetes management
(insulin glargine, insulin lispro), antidepressants (fluoxetine), and pain management (oxycodone,
acetaminophen). Supportive care involved ventilator weaning, enteral nutrition via PEG, physical and
occupational therapy, and management of complications like anemia, dysphagia, and DVTs.
The current treatment plan includes ongoing physical, occupational, and speech therapy to address functional
deficits, pain and spasticity management through interventions like stretching and positioning, home health

Factual Allegations
19.
On February 17, 2023, Frank Ward suffered a stroke and was brought to St. Joseph's
Candler Hospital. A CT scan of his head and CT angiogram were performed and revealed a right
M1 occlusion. He was given labetalol, started on Cardene drip, and given Tenecteplase.
20
Mr. Ward was then transferred to Savannah Memorial Hospital ("Savannah Memorial" or
"Hospital") at around 8:56a.m. on February 17, 2023.
21.
When he arrived at Savannah Memorial, Mr. Ward was taken for an urgent thrombectomy
of the right middle cerebral artery. As a result of the thrombectomy, Mr. Ward had reported
improved blood flow.
22
Following the thrombectomy, Mr. Ward was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit ("ICU")
for continued monitoring and a higher level of care.
23.
One concern for patients who have suffered stroke is brain swelling that often occurs as a
consequence of the stroke. If the brain swells too much, the

inued monitoring and a higher level of care.
23.
One concern for patients who have suffered stroke is brain swelling that often occurs as a
consequence of the stroke. If the brain swells too much, the swelling will cause further injury and
possible hemorrhage to the brain.
24.
To control the swelling, Plaintiff's treating neurosurgeon, Dr. Daniel Suh, ordered a 3%
saline solution which was delivered to Mr. Ward starting on February 19, 2023.

Furthermore, on February 17, 2023, an order was entered by Kathleen Humkey, MD to
perform neurological checks every hour.
26.
Between February 17 and February 23, 2023, Mr. Ward's physical, cognitive, and verbal
condition improved.
27.
On February 23, 2023 at 2:14a.m., a CT scan of Mr. Ward's showed "evolving large right
MCA subacute infarct with stable mass effect and leftward midline shift of 5 mm, stable."
28.
At 11:06a.m., Dr. Osman Perez noted that Mr. Ward had a stable neurological exam and a
stable CT scan. He further noted that Mr. Ward's best verbal response was "oriented", and his best
motor response was "obeys commands." He also noted that an MRI was pending.
29
At 11:23a.m., Dr. Suh noted that Mr. Ward's repeat CT scan was "stable with minimal
shift no change." His plan was to continue with aggressive ICU care with 3% hypertonic saline
and to slowly taper the hypertonic saline so his sodium could sta

 repeat CT scan was "stable with minimal
shift no change." His plan was to continue with aggressive ICU care with 3% hypertonic saline
and to slowly taper the hypertonic saline so his sodium could start to trend down.
30.
On February 24, 2023, at 2:38a.m., a CT scan showed "Large subacute right MCA territory
infarct is again noted with stable mass effect and leftward midline shift of 5 mm, previously 5
mm." The impression was again noted as stable.
31
At 10:49a.m. on February 24, 2023, Mr. Ward was discharged from the ICU to the internal
medicine service on the medical floor of the Hospital (the "floor").

32.
Before being discharged to the floor, Mr. Ward's saline therapy was discontinued.
33.
From 6:00a.m. until 4:00pm. on February 24, 2023, the nursing flowsheets all indicate
the following:
Eye Opening: Spontaneous
Best Verbal Response: Oriented
Best Motor Response: Obeys Commands
Glasgow Coma Scale: 15
34.
At 5:49p.m. on February 24, 2023, Rachel Tinker, RN signed an order that was authorized
by Thomas Allen, PA to perform neurological checks every four hours from February 24, 2023 at
8:00p.m. until otherwise specified.
35.
Periodic neurological checks were necessary since Mr. Ward remained at risk for brain
swelling, subsequent stroke or other adverse neurological events. A decline in motor, verbal or
cognitive ability would be a sign that Mr. Ward required immediate medical attention and warrant
additional diagnostic imaging, such as a CT Scan, to rule out additional brain injury as a cause of
the decline.
